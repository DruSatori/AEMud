NAME
	sscanf - Parse a string with a given format

SYNOPSIS
	int sscanf(string str, string fmt, mixed var1, mixed var2 ...)

DESCRIPTION
	sscanf works vey much like its Unix counterpart. The string
	str is broken up according to the format pattern in fmt.
	Valid symbols are:

	normal text - matches character for character

	%d - matches an integer number

	%s - matches a character string

	%f - matches a float
		Example:
		sscanf("4.43e-2", "%f", f);
                		       -2
		will set f to 4.43 * 10  .

	%*[dsf] - matches as above, but does not require a variable.

	Return value:
	The number of variables var1, var2 etc that matched.

EXAMPLES
	sscanf("one two", "%s %s", a, b)
	Return == 2, a == "one", b == "two"

	sscanf("one two", "%*s %s", a, b)
	Return == 2, a == "two", b == 0

	This happens because the '%*s' matches a pattern but does
	not assign a variable, so the next assigned match that
	requires a variable will be assigned to the first unset
	variable (which is a) and any others will be ignored.

	If this becomes a problem, I can fix it, however the '*'
	argument is to prevent the need for dummy variables and
	fixing this would negate the purpose.
