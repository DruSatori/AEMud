NAME
	break_string - break a string at regular intervals
	
SYNOPSIS
	string break_string(int|string text, void|int len, 
			    void|int|string indent, void|int start)

DESCRIPTION
	This function breaks a continous string without newlines into a
	a string with newlines inserted at every `len':th character. 

	If 'len' isn't specified or is '0', a players screen width
	setting will be used.

	If 'len' is set to '1', the default of 78 will be used.

	If `indent' is defined and is given as an integer, `indent' number
	of spaces are inserted after every newline. If `indent'	is a string 
	that string is inserted after every newline.

	If indenting is used, you may fine tune the indenting via the
	'start' argument.  This is a number of 'lines' to go by,
	counting from line 1.  A setting in the range of '-1..1' will
	cause all lines to be indented.  Otherwise, it works as follows:
	
 	  - a positive # means start indenting on line 'start'.
	  - a negative # means stop indenting on line 'start'.

	You can produce some nice basic textual formatting by creative
	use of the arguments.

	If 'text' is an integer, the function simply returns 0.
	If 'indent' is greater then 1000, no formatting is done.
	if 'start' is < -100 or > 100, no formatting is done.
